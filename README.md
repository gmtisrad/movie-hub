# Movie Hub

  

Movie Hub allows you to get all of the information you need about any movie located on the Movie Database. The API provides an extensive list of movies to choose from. Once you choose a movie, you are presented with the top ten clips from youtube, any relevant reviews from the New York Times movie reviews stand, and the full cast list of the movie.
